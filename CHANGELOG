# Publify 7.0 beta 1

## New features and enhancement

### Notes and POSSE to Twitter

The most important feature of this new release is the addition of notes. Notes are (more or less) short statuses that were not long enough to deserve a full blog post. Notes come with their own feed you can find in /notes/ and can optionnaly be displayed on your Publify main feed. Notes have auto discovery for twitter account (@publify), hashtags (#publify) and links. 

Notes can optionnaly be pushed to Twitter, with a perma short link back to the original content. They handle Twitter in reply context, so if you reply to a tweet, the original message will be displayed with a proper link just above yours. If the note and perma short link are short enough to fit into 140 characters, the link back is dislayed under the (foo.com something) form. Otherwise, the tweet is sent with a full link to the content.

### Visual editor and self dogfooding

The visual editor and file manager were completely removed in the name of self dogfooding (issue #224 and #164). This was a hard to take decision, as we understand you may be reluctant to use the Markdown, Textile or plain HTML syntaxes. The reason why we finally removed it was simple: none of us would use it, so it was poorly implemented and tested and, for many points, broken.
